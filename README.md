# Print failure detection using anormalib
This repository uses anormalib along with PatchCore in order to train a unsupervised machine learning algorithm to detect 3D print failtures.

# Setup 
Run the code under `Installation of nessasary libraries` section in the file [anomaly_detection.ipynb](./anomaly_detection.ipynb)

Dataset can be found on the Kaggle under `nileshamarathunge/3d-print-failure-detection`.
